VThe CleanH204Everyone team is feeling pressured.\u000a\u000aThey have agreed to a pretty aggressive project schedule with lots of risks and unknowns. To alleviate the risks, and knowing that stories have been initially created in the <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog/" target="_blank">backlog</a>, Lynda organizes a <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2011/march/how-to-hold-an-effective-backlog-grooming-session" target="_blank">story grooming</a> workshop with the goal of reviewing and estimating the minimal viable product stories.\u000a\u000aWhich of the following numbered options would represent the best approach for this workshop given the large number of stories to estimate and the unknowns associated with many of them?\u000a\u000a[[1. Have all team members engage in discussing every story, one at a time, and agree on an estimate together in story points.|AllAgree]]\u000a\u000a[[2. Divide and conquer, where team members pair up and estimate a subset of the stories and discuss as a group afterwards.|DivideConquer]]\u000a\u000a[[3. Ask each member to estimate the stories individually first, in ideal days, as this is what they are more familiar with. Discuss numbers after and agree on an estimate together.|IndividualEstimates]]\u000a\u000a[[4. In addition to Bernie, only invite Johnny and Sofia and rely on their estimates. Given their experience and seniority, they are well positioned to speak on behalf of the team, and this will make for a shorter meeting.|BernieJohnnySofia]]

VStill in their first sprint\u2026\u000a\u000aBernie originally agreed to devote 2 sprints to preliminary architectural and refactoring work before starting new features. After attending a meeting with George, it is clear to him that providing a sneak peak of cool features to customers early on in the cycle would help outshine the competition, which is planning a release in July. \u000a\u000aBernie is considering moving some of the feature work ahead of the architectural sprints (this feature work implies changes in parts of the code targeted for the refactoring).\u000a\u000aYou would advise Bernie to either\u2026\u000a\u000a[[1. Organize a meeting with Johnny, Sofia, and Lynda to discuss the impact of postponing the infrastructure work and the risk of missing their deadline in August. Make the decision only when the risks and impact is clearly understood.|MeetJohnnySofiaLynda]]\u000a\u000a[[2. Swap priorities but ask Lynda to organize a meeting with the data management and web teams to confirm their minimum requirements for August and better understand the impact of a possible delay. Review the backlog and reduce scope as needed. Inform George of the impact to the other 2 teams and to the overall schedule. Start grooming the feature stories ASAP.|SwapPriorities]]\u000a\u000a[[3. Push back on swapping the priorities to secure the schedule and components delivery dates. Discuss a communication plan for the customers with George to maintain their engagement level while they are waiting on their features.|PushBack]]  \u000a\u000a[[4. Working code is not required to get customers\u2019 feedback and excitement on a set of features. Remind George that the long-term success of the project depends on the refactoring and components work. Suggest engaging customers now by providing them with preliminary mockups and paper designs for the new features. Use their feedback as input to the design.

This type of thinking and behavior could potentially result in re-work for the team as well. Team members should be comfortable in raising the risk to their Lynda and Bernie and figure out a plan to at a minimum obtain UX guidance and feedback loops from the UX team even if adding a full-time resource is not an option. One of the hardest parts of agile is changing culture. Teams choosing this path is a step in the right direction. \u000a\u000aEmployees\u2019 Engagement (-1): \u000aAlthough the team displays high trust in their product owner, they are conscious of their shortcoming in UX expertise. Relying on themselves alone without seeking external advices/review is likely to reduce their confidence level although getting the feedback from customers later on may compensate for this shortcoming (in the hope that the initial solution will be accepted). \u000a\u000aCustomer Satisfaction (+1): \u000aWhile the team may \u201cget the job done\u201d, their absence of UX skills will likely result in sub-optimal solutions. That said, customers\u2019 involvement during the beta will make up for this and they are likely to be happy for getting their hands on cool features early. \u000a\u000aVelocity (-1): \u000aProductivity is neither helped nor hindered although the lack of customer involvement early on (pre-beta) is likely to generate some unplanned rework, which may impact their velocity and ability to reach their goal.\u000a\u000aReady for the next [[scenario?|Scenario 4]]

VNow in their third sprint\u2026\u000a\u000aAfter discussing with various teams during lunch, Johnny is worried about the product group\u2019s ability to meet their release goals.  Given the existing skills gap, the tight deadlines, and the inter-team dependencies for exposing shared services later in the year, he has decided to start working, on his own time, on some core features that will be required by the data management team, whose members have become close friends over the years.  This work is not planned in their sprint. Johnny believes that in nurturing his well established relationships with the data management team, they may eventually return the favor when prioritizing their own requirements, and help the overall group succeed.  This creates a disagreement with Marc and Kevin who both think that this shouldn\u2019t be necessary for getting work done. They are also worried about  burning out Johnny. \u000a\u000aGiven the good intentions of Johnny and concerns of other team members, you advise Lynda to\u2026\u000a\u000a[[1. Confirm with Johnny that he can sustain the pace without impacting the current sprint goals. Let him continue working on the data management features and tolerate the scenario for future sprints, as long as you don\u2019t see any negative impact to your team\u2019s success.|Confirm]] \u000a\u000a[[2. Discuss Johnny\u2019s current stories with Bernie with the intent of pushing some to the following sprints to make room for the unplanned additional work. Stress the importance of that work for the overall success of the release. Ask Johnny to estimate the data management work remaining and record it as stories. Add them in the backlog and in future sprint planning for Johnny to own.|Discuss]] \u000a\u000a[[3. Ask Johnny to put the extra work on hold to avoid jeopardizing their sprint goals. Maintain his focus on your team. Meanwhile, invite Bernie and the team to discuss the scope, value, risk, impact, effort, and trade off of taking on the data management team\u2019s work. Ask Bernie to reprioritize the backlog in light of their discussion for the following sprints.|Ask Johnny]]\u000a\u000a[[4. Tolerate the scenario for the current sprint.

They are able to accomplish most tasks reasonably efficiently, but still have to do their best on some of the more complicated cloud technologies. They aren\u2019t sure if what they are doing is right, but it seems to be holding together.  \u000a\u000aEmployees\u2019 engagement (+1): \u000aThe team is sad to see Johnny go, but are happy to learn from him while he\u2019s still around. They are excited to learn some new skills. Johnny has been working with this team for 18 months now and has developed some great friends. He\u2019s going to be joining a new team, and knows there will be the storming, forming, norming, and performing cycle. He\u2019ll just have to get through it as quickly as he can. \u000a\u000aCustomer satisfaction (-1): \u000aCustomers have to wait until Johnny can finish up his current work before even starting to look at the work for the other team. He also leaves his team short on skills, delaying the delivery of both teams work. \u000a\u000aVelocity (-1): \u000aWhen Johnny leaves the team there is certainly an impact to velocity. When he joins the new team there is also a small (negative) impact to velocity, but over time the velocity of the new team increases with the additional team member. Overall velocity is a wash.\u000a\u000aReady for the next [[scenario?|Scenario 5]]

It seems like something of a promotion to him. He\u2019s going to be off on his own, doing his own thing, not having to be committed to those sill sprint deadlines.

The team owns sprint commitment and just because the PO approves doesn\u2019t make it OK to change the commitment. They didn\u2019t sign up for this, but are now required to deliver on it. \u000a\u000aCustomer Satisfaction (-1): \u000aJohnny is task switching between his work and the other work his team had already committed to, but because of all of the task switching is delivering less, not to mention that the original scope has been reduced to make room for this new work, resulting in customers not receiving as much. \u000a\u000aVelocity (-1): \u000aJohnny is working on things from both data management and core team, causing him to task switch constantly and costing the team productivity.

He\u2019s working much more, but not really producing any more. \u000a\u000aVelocity (-1): \u000aJohnny works much harder, but due to all of the task switching he\u2019s doing combined with the unsustainable pace, he doesn\u2019t produce more work, just more effort.\u000a\u000a\u000aReady for the next [[scenario?|Scenario 6]]\u000a

VStill in sprint 4\u2026\u000a\u000aWhile your product is in its beta phase, your competition has just released their new version, introducing features that George fears will make you lose market share. To avoid the loss of important customers George proposes and insists that Bernie bring in 2 of the cool features that were planned for next release and ship them during the beta cycle. These features are not yet designed. This change in scope has an impact on the team\u2019s backlog and priorities and will set the team off-track, jeopardizing the work they had committed to for the release.\u000a\u000aYour advice to Lynda and Bernie would be to first\u2026\u000a\u000a[[1. Review the backlog priorities and right away insert the new features at the top, thus refocusing the next sprints.

VStill in Sprint 5\u2026.\u000a\u000aTechnical debt is growing at a constant pace. There are no signs of relief in the plan and no time to address the root causes. This is slowing the team in addition to creating less robust code.  Automation tests have recently started failing, and the failures have been ignored since only Johnny has the knowledge to fix them.\u000a\u000aGiven the scenario, you recommend that the team\u2026\u000a\u000a[[1. Acknowledge there isn\u2019t time to address the debt. Put a system in place to start monitoring debt as you are incurring it. Monitor the debt and report it to Bernie and George. Create a story for the next sprint to fix broken automated tests. Ensure the entire team is educated on the system and can fix future issues.|No time]]\u000a\u000a[[2. At their next planning meeting, review all broken scripts and make it a priority for Johnny to fix all automation errors so the build and tests run. Make a rule that from now on all broken tests will be addressed immediately by Johnny to avoid this scenario repeating itself. Leave tech debt aside for now.|Review broken sprints]]\u000a\u000a[[3. Slow down on feature development for the next sprint. Make it a goal to identify and fix all broken tests, assess the state of the technical debt in the system, and the impact and risk of letting it go unattended. Review the definition of done to incorporate elements of debt and tests health. Ask Johnny to educate the team on the automation system.|Slow down]]\u000a\u000a[[4. Suggest that George asks 1 or 2 engineers to use an off-the-shelf tool in order to scan the code and identify risky and problematic areas in the code. With these reports in hand, discuss of a strategy to address it. Capture the strategy in a technical debt epic and start distributing the work among the team during this release. Leave automation alone for now.|Use tool]]
